## Scaffolding Database

To perform the scaffolding it is necessary to open the package management console and use the command: **Add-Migration Initial-Migration**

Subsequently, to apply the newly created migration to the database it is necessary to use the command: **Update-Database**

The scaffolding of the database must be performed from the Package Management Console, making sure that the default project (drop-down menu) is **Blazor.FacileBudget.DataAccess**

## Deploy via docker

After launching the publish command **dotnet publish -c Release**

Before publishing via docker, it is necessary to check the presence of the **_framework** folder and the javascript files **service-worker.js** and **service-worker-assets.js** in the **wwwroot** folder.

If these are not present, it is possible to integrate them with a simple copy and paste from the Blazor project directory: **Blazor.FacileBudget\Client\bin\Release\net5.0\wwwroot**

If these files are omitted for some reason, the application will not be visible / available while browsing from the browser and the fixed message **loading...** will remain.
